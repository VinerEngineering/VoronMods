**Squashy Feet will replace the BOM Rubber Feet.**

Squash balls will reduce noise and will dampen the printer's vibrations. 

Use Voron part printing guidelines. Printed parts are drop-in replacements for Z-Drive Baseplates. Use the same Hardware.

You will need 4x squash balls (super slow, double yellow dot, diameter 39.5-40.5 mm).

If you want to open the bottom panel, remove the two squash balls on the side of the hinge.
